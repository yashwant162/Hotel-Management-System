This is the readme file for our C project.
The main goal of the project is to display a menu driven interface which allows the user to
interact with different files containing details which can be used to book a room in the Clark Group of hotels.
The program allows the user to view the locations availabe, rooms available, average rating of the hotel, room details,
the cheapest room available. It also allows the user to register and book a room of their choice (based on availability),
receive the total bill and delete their account.

Instuctions on how to compile and execute the files:
Command for compiling the files - make all
Command for running the program - ./exe
Command for deleting .o files - make clean
Once the code is run, a menu appears prompting the user to select an operation to be performed.
